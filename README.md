# FactoryCraft

  This project, which is called **Factory Craft** as you may have noticed, is a **Minecraft plugin** and is about machines, new materials, and industry stuff in general.

  It is **inspired by Minecraft mods** like IndustrialCraft 2, BuildCraft 3, ThaumCraft 2 and others.

  The project is still under strong development so I can't really show anything yet but as soon as I have something to show I will post it on my reddit!

  * **Crusher**
  * **Custom Items**

  **This project is currently not reall being worked on and will eventually get a big refactor in the future!**
